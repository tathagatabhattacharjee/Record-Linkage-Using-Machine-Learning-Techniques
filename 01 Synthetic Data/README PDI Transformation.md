The original source data from Kisesa HDSS, developed in an event history format by Rentsch Christopher, was designed to support record linkage using a probabilistic method, followed by a prospective approach for confirmation by the study participant. This dataset, which recorded each movement as separate events across multiple rows, has now been transformed into a wide format. This conversion ensures that all the movements of a study participant, including entries and exits within the Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) area, are consolidated into a single row. This streamlined format simplifies the analysis by allowing each participant's residency history to be viewed comprehensively, facilitating more efficient and accurate record linkage, when doe using the Retropective approach. The methodology was initially implemented as part of the Point-of-contact Interactive Record Linkage (PIRL) project, which aimed to link HDSS and HIV clinic data. Full details on the original process and the software can be found on GitHub [Reg GitHub - https://github.com/LSHTM-ALPHAnetwork/PIRL_RecordLinkageSoftware].

In this study, the initial step for generating a synthetic dataset from the original Kisesa HDSS data involves converting the long format (event history format) into a wide format, consolidating all movements of each study participant into a single row. Once this transformation is complete, the synthetic dataset is generated based on the newly structured data.

The Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) Community Edition transformation, titled "Data Preparation Longitudinal 1.ktr," is responsible for converting the data from a long format (event history format) to a wide format. This transformation consolidates multiple records of an individualâ€™s movements into a single row, enabling a comprehensive view of each participant's residency episodes within the dataset.
